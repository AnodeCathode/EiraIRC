EiraIRC
=======

Minecraft Mod. On a Minecraft client it acts like any other IRC client, on the server it turns into a bridge-bot. Configuration is highly customizable and the mod includes a few special features such as name colors, Twitch chat and screenshot upload.

##API
The latest EiraIRC API and a deobfuscated version of the mod can be downloaded from my [Jenkins](http://jenkins.blay09.net) (v2.8 only). A maven repository to host the API is planned.

##Repacking Textures
EiraIRC reads its UI textures from a [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) TextureAtlas.
The repository root contains a project file for the [libGDX TexturePacker GUI](https://code.google.com/p/libgdx-texturepacker-gui/).
As of now, only a TextureAtlas of size 256x256 is supported.
