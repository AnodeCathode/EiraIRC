EiraIRC
=======

Minecraft Mod. On a Minecraft client it acts like any other IRC client, on the server it turns into a bridge-bot. Configuration is highly customizable and the mod includes a few special features such as name colors, Twitch chat and screenshot upload.

##API
The easiest way to add EiraIRC to your development environment is to do some additions to your build.gradle file. First, register EiraIRC's maven repository by adding the following lines:

```
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "dynmap"
        url = "http://repo.mikeprimm.com/"
    }
    maven {
        name = "eiramods"
        url ="http://repo.blay09.net"
    }
}
```
> Note: The reference to the dynmap repository is necessary at the moment because it's stored as a dependency in EiraIRC's maven files. I'm still looking for a way around that.

Then, add dependencies to either just the EiraIRC API (api) or, if you want EiraIRC to be available while testing as well, the deobfuscated version (dev) too:

```
dependencies {
    compile 'net.blay09.mods:eirairc:2.8.111:dev' // or just api instead of dev
}
```

Done! Run gradle to update your project and you'll be good to go.

The latest EiraIRC API and an unobfuscated version of the mod can also be downloaded from my [Jenkins](http://jenkins.blay09.net) (v2.8 only), if you're not into all that maven stuff.

##Repacking Textures
EiraIRC reads its UI textures from a [libGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) TextureAtlas.
The repository root contains a project file for the [libGDX TexturePacker GUI](https://code.google.com/p/libgdx-texturepacker-gui/).
As of now, only a TextureAtlas of size 256x256 is supported.
